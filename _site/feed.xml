In fact, I was convinced to write my articles on my personal account on &lt;a href=&quot;https://medium.com/@joaov&quot;&gt;Medium&lt;/a&gt; and everything should be fine. It was when I realized that Medium now has paywalls and limits how many articles you can read per month with the free plan. Ok, it goes against what I believe to be the potential way to Medium go but, I wonâ€™t judge its business plans.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Well, hereâ€™s the options I had:&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Cry like a baby because Medium was really great back days.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;
    &lt;p&gt;Go back to the days when I builded some blogs with traditional platforms such as Blogger, Wordpress or evenâ€¦ Tumblr.&lt;/p&gt;
  &lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Build my personal blog by my own.&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, itâ€™s clear what was my choice. So, I ran to search how I would achieve this task and how much this would cost. Hereâ€™s the big point:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h1 id=&quot;ive-found-a-solution-that-builds-a-full-blog-with-just-one-command-which-can-be-hosted-by-github-pages-and-its-totally-free&quot;&gt;Iâ€™ve found a solution that builds a full blog with just one command, which can be hosted by GitHub Pages and itâ€™s totally free.&lt;/h1&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, my friends. Maybe for some of you it isnâ€™t something new but, for me, it just blew my mind!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;a href=&quot;https://jekyllrb.com&quot;&gt;Jekyll&lt;/a&gt; is the name of our great solution here. It works with &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.ruby-lang.org&quot;&gt;Ruby&lt;/a&gt; (but donâ€™t you worry if you never saw anything about it), so you have to install it on your machine before start to work with Jekyll.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After this, you have to install the Jekyll and bundler gems with this command on your terminal:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;gem install jekyll bundler&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Then you can start your first project with:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure class=&quot;highlight&quot;&gt;&lt;pre&gt;&lt;code class=&quot;language-text&quot; data-lang=&quot;text&quot;&gt;jekyll new your-project&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And thatâ€™s all! Your blog is ready (or almost it). All you have to do now is follow the documentation and set it up with your info.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Jekyll has a great documentation and a large community who supports and develops themes for many tastes. I strongly recommend you to look up for more information about Jekyll. Itâ€™s a tiny tool, able to build huge projects.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For free.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Enjoy it! ðŸ˜ƒ&lt;/p&gt;</content><author><name></name></author><category term="jekyll" /><summary type="html">Iâ€™ve been searching for a nice place to publish my ideas and create some content about something.
