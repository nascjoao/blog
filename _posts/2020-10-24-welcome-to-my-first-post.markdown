I've been searching for a nice place to publish my ideas and create some content about something. In fact, I was convinced to write my articles on my personal account on [Medium][Medium] and everything should be fine. It was when I realized that Medium now has paywalls and limits how many articles you can read by month with the free plan. Ok, it goes against what I believe to be the potential way to Medium go but, I won't judge its business plans. 

Well, here's the options I had:

1. Cry like a baby because Medium was really great back days.
2. Go back to the days when I builded some blogs with traditional platforms such as Blogger, Wordpress or even... Tumblr.

3. Build my personal blog by my own.

At this point, it's clear what was my choice. So, I ran to search how I would achieve this task and how much this would cost. Here's the big point:

# I've found a solution that builds a full blog with just one command, which can be hosted by GitHub Pages and it's totally free.

Yes, my friends. Maybe for some of you it isn't something new but, for me, it just blew my mind!

[Jekyll][Jekyll] is the name of our great solution here. It works with [Ruby][Ruby] (but don't you worry if you never saw anything about it), so you have to install it on your machine before start to work with Jekyll.

After this, you have to install the Jekyll and bundler gems with this command on your terminal:
{% highlight bash %}
gem install jekyll bundler
{% endhighlight %}

Then you can start your first project with:
{% highlight bash %}
jekyll new your-project
{% endhighlight %}

And that's all! Your blog is ready (or almost it). All you have to do now is follow the documentation and set it up with your info.

Jekyll has a great documentation and a large community who supports and develops themes for many tastes. I strongly recommend you to look up for more information about Jekyll. It's a tiny tool, able to build huge projects.

For free.

Enjoy it! ðŸ˜ƒ
